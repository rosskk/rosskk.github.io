Problem: A lot of campus events (namely non club related) go unnoticed by many of the students.

Solution: Create a website/application that allows organizers to submit events and allows user to attend those events. We may also be able to include the locations of the events on campus and other details about the event that may not be on, say, a poster for example. 

Mockup example:

<ul>
<li>Landing page</li>
<li>Events page</li>
<li>Description page</li>
<li>Map page (for all events)</li>
<li>User page</li>  
<li>Add/Modify event page page</li>  
</ul>

Case Ideas
User may go to the landing page and navigate to the list of events page on campus to see if there may be anything that they like. Then they can click on an event and it will direct them to another page with the event and all the details about the event. Organizers can easily make an event and include everything that they may want to say about the event as well as place the location on a map of the campus to let people know where it is. 

People may be able to connect with others that attend the same events.
