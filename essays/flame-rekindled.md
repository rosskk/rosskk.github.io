As soon as I learned about computers, my video game career took off. I remember starting off playing some Ben10 game on the Cartoon Network game site and enjoying every minute of it. But I digress, point is, I've been around computers for a fairly long amount of time be it playing games or working on assignments. For a while however, I never really thought about much more than that for my computer usage. It wasn't until my Sophomore year of high school that I took my first computer science class and began to learn bits of what coding is. I'll admit though, our teacher taught the class in a way that was different from most and it completely threw me off. No matter what we did, I could never really pick it up, and by the end I felt like I didn't know any more than when I came into the class. Then, I put off coding for the rest of high school until college came around the corner and I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. It was at that point that I thought about my options. I could go into math or physics but I'm only around average at math and even worse at physics. I did enjoy the field though so if I put in more effort than before it could still be a possibility. But then it hit me, I learned about coding back in high school so what if I decided to pick it up again to see if it was also an option for me. With that in mind, I spoke to Gerald and got thrown into the program and took my first ICS classes. After picking up the basics and learning what suffering was like, I realized that I loved this field and that nothing else would pique my interest as much as coding would. My coding fire that I thought had died out in high school had been rekindled and my career set in motion.

In the future hope to go into some sort of game development, be it at a small or large company if it at all possible. All my life I've wanted to play games but now I want to make them and really hope to be able to fulfill this dream. If I'm not able to start my game dev career right after college, hopefully I can get a job at some sort of tech company to learn the ropes and possibly do some game coding on the side to learn the industry and work on personal projects. This is the direction I'd like to aim but who knows what happens in a few years.
