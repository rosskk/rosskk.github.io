If you had to pick between doing more or less work, which would you pick? If you are rewarded based off the amount of work that you do then the lazy people (like me) would probably choose to do less work just because they don’t want to do more. But what if you get rewarded the same amount regardless of the amount of work that you do. Now even diligent workers would probably go with the lower amount simply because that is the rational decision. Why do more work when you don’t need to, right? Well, this is what using a UI framework is like. It allows you to get the same job done without needing to create all of your own modules. 

Bill Gates once said “I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.” Being the lazy person that I know I am, I enjoy using Semantic UI. It takes time to learn the framework and how to use it but it is well worth it in the long run. Just like the old saying “Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime.” Once you learn the framework, you can use it for everything and it makes your life much easier. It certainly made making menus and putting in special icons much easier. All I need to do is put in a simple line of code and I’m good to go. 

Overall, UI frameworks like Semantic UI make things much easier for lazy people like me. With some time spent learning the framework, we can do things much quicker than manually coding everything. We can even mimic our favorite websites with relative ease even if it’s only a rudimentary version. Through the hard work of the people who made the framework, we can work smarter and faster because why make code that already exists and is easily accessible. This is from an efficiency standpoint and not from a “practice makes perfect” one. From a teaching perspective, it becomes much easier to teach people the basics if they can skip the hard parts and learn the concepts. That way, in the future they’ll have a much easier time when it does come to the hard parts because they’ll know what they need to do and can work out how to do it.
