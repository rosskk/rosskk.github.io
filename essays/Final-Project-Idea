Problem: A lot of campus events (namely non club related) go unnoticed by many of the students.

Solution: Create a website/application that allows organizers to submit events and allows user to attend those events. We may also be able to include the locations of the events on campus and other details about the event that may not be on, say, a poster for example. 

Mockup example:

<ul>
<li>Landing page</li>
<li>Events page</li>
<li>Description page</li>
<li>Map page (for all events)</li>
</ul>
